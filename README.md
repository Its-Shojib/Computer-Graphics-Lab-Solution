# Computer Graphics Lab Solutions

Welcome to the Computer Graphics Lab Solutions repository! This repository contains solutions and implementations for various computer graphics lab exercises and projects. It is designed to help students and enthusiasts understand fundamental concepts and algorithms in computer graphics.

## Algorithms Included

### 1. Bresenham's Line Drawing Algorithm
Bresenham's line algorithm is an efficient way to draw a straight line between two points on a grid-based display. It uses integer calculations for better performance.

### 2. Digital Differential Analyzer (DDA) Line Drawing Algorithm
The DDA algorithm is a simple and accurate method to draw a line segment between two points using floating-point arithmetic.

### 3. Cohen-Sutherland Line Clipping Algorithm
The Cohen-Sutherland algorithm is a popular method for line clipping in computer graphics. It efficiently clips a line segment to a rectangular viewport using region codes.
